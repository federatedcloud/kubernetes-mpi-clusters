Plan:
My goal is a script/set-up that will build the entire set-up by having the user run one command.

The first step needs to be creating the cluster/node pools
After this I might need to specifically create the mpi-operator namespace
Then, I can create the mpi-operator resources
Finally, I can run the HPL mpijob. This might be able to run at the same step as the others.
