Overview
=====
Much of this guide is from other sources scattered throughout the internet. The purpose of this is to provide a fast track to getting started with Kubernetes with all the information you need in one place. Wherever another source is used, it will be linked either at the bottom of the relevant section or directly where it applies.

The file `INSTALLATION.md` covers what tools you'll need to get started, how to install them, and how to verify they are working.

The file `LOCALCLUSTER.md` covers the basics of setting up a cluster that runs on your machine with a tool called Minikube.
